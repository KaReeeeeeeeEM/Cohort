## Installation

Here we shall first learn on how to host your website locally in the Virtual Server using HTTP on the default port 80.

1. Clone your repository
   The repository name in github has a signature of .git whereas the repository url is supposed to have a format of 'https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git'.
   To clone your repository, you use the command 'git clone' as shown below:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   You might perform additional steps depending on your project. Here are the additional steps that you may need to do.
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
   Then Install the necessary dependancies:
     - If you are using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
     - If you are using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    Lastly, start your project:
   ```bash
   npm start #if you are using npm
   yarn start #if you are using yarn
   ```
